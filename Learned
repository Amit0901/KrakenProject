I learned how to make different repositories in GitHub and how to share the project to others. This allowed me to invite collaborators
and in the future it will allow me to share my projects. I also explored more on branching and combining projects.

GitKraken was a very new application for me, I never used anything like it in the past.
	It was very difficult to use to start, but eventually I got a hang of it. 
	I learned how to push and pull from the partner application/website of GitHub to recover data.
	Merging was definetly the most difficult part, I had to figure out how and when to merge to the main file.
	There were times where we merged from the main fil out, rather than in, so it was a learning experience.
